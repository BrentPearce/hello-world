# hello-world
basic trying to understand git hub
I'm trying to learn programing after a "long" time as an undergrad in chemical engineering.
I'm the father of 3 (soon to be 4) chidren 2 girls and 1 boy (and an as of yet mystery child) and I'm
married to the woman of my dreams, she is amazing and I love her so so much. I really like bikes and old
school DE shaving(if only I had more money, oh well).
